This project is inspired by this project:

The first steps now are to have a Magic: the Gathering engine that's capable
of goldfishing modern Gifts Storm following some basic hard coded heuristics. The next
step is to be able to write games to a database efficiently. Eventually, I hope to expand
this game engine to be able to support all tier 1/2 modern decks, and develop 
some kind of AI to find optimal lines and experiment with other cards.
